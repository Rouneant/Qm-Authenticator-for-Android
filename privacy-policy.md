**Last Updated:** 2025/11/22  
**Effective Date:** 2025/11/22

## Introduction

**Qm Authenticator** (hereinafter referred to as "the App") is an open-source two-factor authenticator developed by **QmDeve** (hereinafter referred to as "we" or "us"). Your privacy and security are our top priorities.

This Privacy Policy is designed to clearly inform you that **the App does NOT collect, store, upload, or share any of your personal data with any third parties.**

## 1. Core Principle: No Data Collection

We firmly believe that for a security tool, the best policy is to not handle user data at all. Therefore, we explicitly state:

- **Zero Data Collection:** The App does not collect, transmit, or store your personal information, identity, or generated codes (TOTP tokens) to our servers or any third-party servers in any way.
- **All Data Stored Locally:** All account information, secrets, and generated codes are **encrypted and stored solely on your device's local storage.** This is the fundamental way the App operates.

## 2. Permission Usage Clarification

To provide core functionality, the App requests the following permissions, which are used strictly and exclusively for the purposes outlined below:

- **Network Permission (INTERNET / ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE):**
  - **Sole Purpose:** To automatically connect to the GitHub Releases page when you **launch the App** to check if a new version is available. You will be notified if an update is found.
  - **We Commit:** This permission is not used for any other network communication and **never transmits any of your App data.**

- **Camera Permission (CAMERA):**
  - **Sole Purpose:** To scan the QR code provided by other services for quickly adding two-factor authentication accounts.
  - **We Commit:** This permission is used solely for local QR code recognition. The scanned information is immediately encrypted and saved into your device's local database. **We do not record video, take pictures for storage, or upload the scanned content anywhere.**

## 3. Data Security

- We have no access to and cannot recover this data from your device.
- **Please ensure you keep your device secure.** If you uninstall the App or clear its data, all locally stored account information will be **permanently lost**, and we cannot recover it for you.
